## üîÜ [see live](https://yuwen-dieta.netlify.app) 
## backend server goes [here](https://github.com/yuwen-c/dieta-api)


## I built this because...üí°
- I was in dieta and needed to calculate calorie every week, for about 15 weeks in total.
- There were so many repetitions in it, so I decided to build a system so that next time I'll go though the diet with less effort.
- I also recommended this project to my coach, hope this project can help more people! ü•∞
